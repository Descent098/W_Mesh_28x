# Wonder Mesh

*Blender addon for creating and editing parametric objects.*

For blender versions <= 2.79 use [this repo](https://github.com/WiresoulStudio/Wonder_Mesh) instead

Essentially this addon will let you tweak, and control settings in a non-destructive way. Then if you want to do traditional polygon modeling, you just convert it to a normal mesh!
